The code repository for the ML work I did on the Gravity Diagnostics project. 5 neural nets were built to classify 5 target gene sequences within PCR test data.
Models were trained and tested on over 175000 hand labelled test results, achieving a 99.9% accuracy in training and testing.
In production, across 1M tests in side by side testing, the set of models achieved a 100% first pass accuracy rate.
